After joining ICBC (Asia), OIC\u2019d tried a couple of time to cooperate with Pamfleet, but was in vain owing to the more aggressive offer given by Pamfleet\u2019s partner banks, like CITIC Ka Wah Bank.  However, due to ICBCA business scale, network plus OIC\u2019s marketing effort and cordial relationship, Pamfleet agreed to provide an industry / office acquisition project for our consideration.\n\nIn this project, Pamfleet is to cooperate with Angelo Gordon Group (\u201cAngelo Gordon\u201d), a US investment company dedicated to alternative investment to form a fund, which will be used to acquire Ever Gain Plaza located in Kwai Chung (the \u201cProperty\u201d) or the companies holding the Property.",
