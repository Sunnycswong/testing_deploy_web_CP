This project aims to enhance the existing MTR network by extending the East West Corridor, providing improved connectivity and transportation options for residents and commuters. While specific details about the project are limited, the MTR Corporation has put forward several future projects to the Hong Kong Government, some of which are still in the planning stage. One of the key components of the East West Corridor Expansion project is the proposed East Kowloon line. This line would connect Diamond Hill station via Hung Hom station to Sheung Wan station, providing a metro service in the opposite direction to Po Lam station and HKUST Station via Sau Mau Ping . However, it is important to note that as of now, there is no schedule for construction for this line. In addition to the East Kowloon line, there are other proposed projects that could contribute to the expansion of the East West Corridor. These include the Tung Chung to Tai O Light Rail System, which would provide a light rail link between Tung Chung station and Tai O Fishing Village on Lantau Island, and the Cable Car System from Ngong Ping to Tai O, which would offer an alternative transportation option between these two locations. Furthermore, the MTR Corporation has proposed the construction of an underground tunnel eastwards of Hong Kong station for overrun tracks. This would allow Tung Chung line and Airport Express trains to turn around, enhancing the potential frequency of operation and improving efficiency. While these projects are part of the MTR Corporation's future plans, it is important to note that specific timelines for construction and completion have not been provided for all of them. The MTR Corporation continues to work with the Hong Kong Government to develop and implement these projects, taking into consideration various factors such as feasibility, funding, and public demand.",

This risk arises from the borrowing activities of the group at the parent company level, including its financing vehicles.\n\n2. Fixed and floating rate debt mix: The group manages its interest rate risk exposure by maintaining a level of fixed rate debt between 55% and 75% of total debt outstanding. Deviations from this model may require the procurement of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to align the fixed and floating rate mix.\n\n3. Sensitivity to interest rate changes: A 100 basis points increase or decrease in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, is estimated to impact the group's profit after tax and retained profits by approximately HK$82 million or HK$78 million. Other components of consolidated equity would also be affected.\n\n4. Management of subsidiary and associate companies: Interest rate risk at subsidiary and associate companies is managed separately based on their own borrowing requirements, circumstances, and market practices.\n\n5. Offsetting floating rate borrowings: The group offsets its exposure to floating rate borrowings by earning floating rate interest income from cash balances, bank deposits, and other investment instruments.\n\n6. Foreign exchange risk: While not directly related to interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk is another significant risk faced by the group. It arises when assets and liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the group's companies. The group manages this risk through hedging strategies such as cross currency swaps and forward contracts.\n\n7. Currency risk associated with payment commitments: Most of the group's payment commitments denominated in foreign currencies are covered by foreign exchange forward contracts, reducing the significant currency risk associated with them.\n\nOverall, the project faces interest rate risks due to market fluctuations, the management of fixed and floating rate debt, and the potential impact of interest rate changes on profitability and equity. Additionally, foreign exchange risk adds another layer of risk management complexity to the project.",

The Group estimates the impact of a 100 basis points increase or decrease in interest rates on its profit after tax, retained profits, and other components of consolidated equity. The sensitivity analysis is based on the assumption that the change in interest rates occurred at the end of the reporting period and was applied to both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. The Group also manages its foreign exchange risk exposure by maintaining a modest level of unhedged non-Hong Kong dollar debt and minimal foreign exchange open positions. It converts foreign currency exposure resulting from borrowings to Hong Kong dollar exposure through cross currency swaps and secures necessary foreign currencies at pre-determined exchange rates for settlement through foreign exchange forward contracts. The Group's exposure to US dollars due to foreign currency borrowings is offset by the amount of US dollar cash balances, bank deposits, and investments it maintains.
