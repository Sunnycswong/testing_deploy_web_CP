After joining ICBC (Asia), OIC\u2019d tried a couple of time to cooperate with Pamfleet, but was in vain owing to the more aggressive offer given by Pamfleet\u2019s partner banks, like CITIC Ka Wah Bank.  However, due to ICBCA business scale, network plus OIC\u2019s marketing effort and cordial relationship, Pamfleet agreed to provide an industry / office acquisition project for our consideration.\n\nIn this project, Pamfleet is to cooperate with Angelo Gordon Group (\u201cAngelo Gordon\u201d), a US investment company dedicated to alternative investment to form a fund, which will be used to acquire Ever Gain Plaza located in Kwai Chung (the \u201cProperty\u201d) or the companies holding the Property.",

Despite previous unsuccessful attempts to cooperate with Pamfleet, due to more aggressive offers from Pamfleet's partner banks, such as CITIC Ka Wah Bank, the OIC's marketing efforts and cordial relationship with Pamfleet have led to an agreement for a potential industry/office acquisition project.\n\nIn this project, Pamfleet and Angelo Gordon Group will form a fund dedicated to alternative investment. The purpose of this fund is to acquire Ever Gain Plaza, which is located in Kwai Chung, or the companies holding the property. Further information regarding the specifics of the project, such as the timeline, financial details, and potential risks, is not provided in the given context.
